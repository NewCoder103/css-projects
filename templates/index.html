            <h1>Why to upgrade to Linux</h1>

            <p>We all know the pain of when Windows decides to update when you want to shut it down. However, with Linux,
            you dictate when you want to update. <br>But, these updates are not triggered on shutdown.
            Instead, we update using the system's package manager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)" id="word-apt">APT</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Why is this important? Well, Linux's ecosystem doesn't simply function off of proprietary software,
            but instead, by open-source. <br> Linux works thanks to the power of open-sourced software, and thanks
            to that, we don't need to always restart when an update is required.
